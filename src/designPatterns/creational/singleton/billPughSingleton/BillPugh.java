/**
 * Prior to Java 5, the Java memory model had a lot of issues, and the previous approaches used to fail in certain
 * scenarios where too many threads tried to get the instance of the singleton class simultaneously. So Bill Pugh
 * came up with a different approach to create the singleton class using an inner static helper class.
 * Here is an example of the Bill Pugh Singleton implementation:
 *
 * Notice the private inner static class that contains the instance of the singleton class. When the singleton class
 * is loaded, SingletonHelper class is not loaded into memory and only when someone calls the getInstance() method,
 * this class gets loaded and creates the singleton class instance. This is the most widely used approach for the
 * singleton class as it doesnâ€™t require synchronization.
