/**
 * The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input,
 * we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class
 * from the client program to the factory class. Letâ€™s first learn how to implement a factory design pattern in java
 * and then we will look into factory pattern advantages. We will see some of the factory design pattern usage in JDK.
 * Note that this pattern is also known as Factory Method Design Pattern.
