/**
 * Why does an abstract class give only partial abstraction?
 *
 * This is because the abstract class can have both abstract as well as non abstract methods and non abstract
 * methods make it partial abstraction.
 *
 * Abstract classes have a default constructor and it is called whenever the concrete subclass is instantiated.
 * It contains Abstract methods as well as Non-Abstract methods.
 * The class which extends the Abstract class shouldnâ€™t require the implementation of all the methods, only Abstract
 * methods need to be implemented in the concrete sub-class.
 * Abstract class contains instance variables.
